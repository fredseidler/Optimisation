# DE 3 Optimisation

Subsystem 3: Lamp geometry and distribution

## Paramaters that need to be set:
* x can be set as either x_ip or x_ga depending on which algorithm is being run.
* This can be set on line 50 of the script.
* x_ip has been set as the default so that when first running the script the results generated match those quoted in the report

## Note about the script:
* All of the parameters have been determined following careful literature research. 
* Hammersmith and Fulham have been used as a good council to focus on due to their relevance to Imperial College students. 
* Where there are variables/paramaters that are linked between subsystems, best-guess values have been used to allow optimisiaiton to continue. 

**All researched values have been referenced at the end of the submitted report.**

## Performance of the script

* The script has been run on a 2.4 GHz 8-Core Intel Core i9 processor
* The interior-point algorithm typically ran in 0.7s
* The genetic algorithm typically ran in 1.9s
